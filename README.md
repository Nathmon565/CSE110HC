# CSE 110 Honors Contract
To complete an Honors Contract for the CSE 110 class, I created a project written in Java. The project is a randomly generated dungeon crawling game, where the key feature is the combat system. Combat is evaluated by the player completing one of three kinds of challenges: Math, Unscramble, and Copy. Enemy health, frequency, and challenge difficulty increases until the player eventually dies. There's also a tavern in between dungeon floors to redeem favors to help the player in the next dungeons. See the in-game tutorial for further details about the game and its mechanics.

## How to run
The program has only been tested on windows and requires Java 16 or newer to run.
In the same folder as the .jar, run the following command in a terminal:
`java -jar .\CSE110HC.jar`
To enable the tutorial, input option 5 on the main menu. This will explain the major features of the game as you progress.
